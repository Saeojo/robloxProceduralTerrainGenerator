Hello my portfolio reviewers! To navigate this repo, there's a few things you need to know:

The .rbxm file allows a direct opening into RobloxStudio, which is the optimal way to see my files. If this isn't possible, I've attempted to emulate RobloxStudio's file format using folders and .lua files.

To navigate, the folder/.lua file structure, you need to know that RobloxStudio allows scripts to be nested within other scripts. To reproduce this, I've put the files nested within any script in a folder with the same name in that script in the same directory.
