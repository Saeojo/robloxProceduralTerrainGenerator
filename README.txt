Hello portfolio reviewers! To navigate this repo, there's a few things you need to know:

The .rbxm file allows a direct opening into RobloxStudio, which is the optimal way to see my files. If this isn't possible, I've attempted to emulate RobloxStudio's file format using folders and .lua files.

To navigate the folder/.lua file structure, you need to know that RobloxStudio allows scripts to be nested within other scripts. To reproduce this, I've put the files nested within any script in a folder with the same name as that script in the same directory.

On another note, I've tried to clarify the code as well as I can with comments, but I've forgotten some of the more complex parts of the code. So, I unfortunately can't explain everything perfectly.

Finally, I haven't uploaded any of my other code to my git, in case you were looking. I do have more, it's just not here.
